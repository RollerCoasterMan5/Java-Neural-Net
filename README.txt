This is a Neural Network that I built from a tutorial on YouTube (link below). The tutorial is in C++ but I programmed my Neural Network in Java.

The TrainingDataGenerator class is used to generate the training data file.
The TrainingData class is a helper class that makes the Neural Network learn from the TrainingData text file.

Feel free to explore and expand upon this project.
